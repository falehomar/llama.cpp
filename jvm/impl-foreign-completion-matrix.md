# Java API for llama.cpp - Implementation Status Matrix

This document provides a matrix of completion status for each API module in the `impl-foreign` implementation.

## Overview

The `impl-foreign` implementation uses the Java Foreign and Native Memory API (Java 21+) to interact with the native llama.cpp library. The implementation has made significant progress, with the class structure in place and the model loading and information retrieval functionality fully implemented. This represents the completion of the first priority in the implementation plan. However, work is still needed to implement tokenization, context and batch processing, sampling, and resource management.

## Completion Status Matrix

| Module | Class | Status | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Root Package** | ForeignLLM | Partial | Class structure in place, native calls for model loading and freeing implemented |
| **Model** | ForeignModelInfo | Partial | Class structure in place, native calls for getting model information implemented (except metadata) |
| **Context** | ForeignContext | Partial | Class structure in place, but native calls for context creation, batch processing, and context freeing not implemented |
| **Batch** | ForeignBatch | Partial | Class structure in place, but native calls for batch creation, updating, and freeing not implemented |
| **Tokenization** | ForeignTokenizer | Partial | Class structure in place, but native calls for tokenization, detokenization, and vocabulary access not implemented |
| **Sampling** | ForeignSampler | Partial | Class structure in place, but native calls for sampler creation, sampling, and freeing not implemented |
| **SPI** | ForeignLLMFactory | Complete | Factory implementation is complete, as it doesn't require direct native calls |
| **Native Library** | NativeLibrary | Partial | Basic functionality for library loading and backend initialization in place, but missing methods for other native functions |

## ForeignLLMTest POC Completion Status

The `ForeignLLMTest` class is a proof-of-concept test that demonstrates how to use the Java API with the Foreign implementation. To get this test working, the following native calls need to be implemented:

### Model Loading and Information
1. ✅ `ForeignLLM.loadModel()` - Calls `llama_model_load_from_file`
2. ✅ `ForeignModelInfo.getParameterCount()` - Calls `llama_model_n_params`
3. ✅ `ForeignModelInfo.getContextSize()` - Calls `llama_model_n_ctx_train`
4. ✅ `ForeignModelInfo.getEmbeddingSize()` - Calls `llama_model_n_embd`
5. ✅ `ForeignModelInfo.getLayerCount()` - Calls `llama_model_n_layer`
6. ✅ `ForeignModelInfo.getHeadCount()` - Calls `llama_model_n_head`
7. ✅ `ForeignModelInfo.getDescription()` - Calls `llama_model_desc`

### Tokenization
8. ❌ `ForeignTokenizer.getVocabHandle()` - Calls `llama_model_get_vocab`
9. ❌ `ForeignTokenizer.tokenize()` - Calls `llama_tokenize`
10. ❌ `ForeignTokenizer.getSpecialToken()` - Needs implementation of special token mapping
11. ❌ `ForeignTokenizer.getTokenText()` - Calls `llama_token_to_piece`

### Context and Batch Processing
12. ❌ `ForeignContext.createContext()` - Calls `llama_init_from_model`
13. ❌ `ForeignBatch.createBatch()` - Calls `llama_batch_init`
14. ❌ `ForeignBatch.updateBatch()` - Updates the batch with tokens
15. ❌ `ForeignContext.process()` - Calls `llama_decode`
16. ❌ `ForeignContext.updateLogits()` - Calls `llama_get_logits`

### Sampling
17. ❌ `ForeignSampler.createSampler()` - Calls `llama_sampler_init`
18. ❌ `ForeignSampler.sample()` - Calls `llama_sampler_sample`

### Resource Management
19. ❌ `ForeignBatch.freeBatch()` - Calls `llama_batch_free`
20. ❌ `ForeignSampler.freeSampler()` - Calls `llama_sampler_free`
21. ❌ `ForeignContext.freeContext()` - Calls `llama_free`
22. ✅ `ForeignLLM.freeModel()` - Calls `llama_model_free`

### Native Library Support
23. ✅ Add methods to `NativeLibrary` for model loading and information retrieval
24. ❌ Add methods to `NativeLibrary` for tokenization, context, batch processing, and sampling

## Implementation Priority

To get the basic functionality of `ForeignLLMTest` working, the following implementation order is recommended:

1. ✅ First Priority: Model loading and basic information retrieval (items 1-7)
2. Second Priority: Tokenization (items 8-11)
3. Third Priority: Context and batch processing (items 12-16)
4. Fourth Priority: Sampling (items 17-18)
5. Fifth Priority: Resource management (items 19-22, item 22 completed)
6. Throughout: Native library support (items 23-24, item 23 completed)

## Conclusion

The `impl-foreign` implementation has made significant progress. The class structure and interface implementations are in place, and the model loading and information retrieval functionality is now fully implemented. This represents the completion of the first priority in the implementation plan.

The implementation now provides a foundation for a Java-centric API using the Java Foreign and Native Memory API, with the ability to load models and retrieve basic information about them. However, work is still needed to implement tokenization, context and batch processing, sampling, and resource management.

To complete the `ForeignLLMTest` POC, approximately 16 more native function bindings need to be implemented across the various classes. This represents a substantial but well-defined development effort that would result in a fully functional Java API for llama.cpp using the modern Java Foreign and Native Memory API.
