## Implementation Strategy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

All tasks should be implemented following Test-Driven Development principles:

1. **Write Tests First**: Before implementing any feature, write tests that define the expected behavior.
2. **Run Tests and Watch Them Fail**: Verify that the tests fail because the functionality doesn't exist yet.
3. **Implement the Minimum Required Code**: Write only enough code to make the tests pass.
4. **Run Tests and Watch Them Pass**: Verify that the implementation satisfies the tests.
5. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring tests still pass.

### Development Process

1. **Small, Focused PRs**: Each task should result in a small, focused pull request.
2. **Code Reviews**: All PRs should be reviewed by at least one other developer.
3. **Continuous Integration**: All PRs should pass CI checks before merging.
4. **Documentation**: All code should be well-documented, including Javadocs.
5. **Update Task Status**: As tasks progress, update the status in this document.

## Status Tracking

Task status should be updated in the matrix above according to these definitions:

- **Not Started**: Task has not been started yet.
- **In Progress**: Task is currently being worked on.
- **In Review**: Implementation is complete and awaiting review.
- **Testing**: Implementation has passed review and is being tested.
